Features:
Development:
	Add tests.
	Add continuous integration.

User experience:
	Add constraints to glsl variables (Valid range, should be normalized, ..).
	Put all errors in a logger instead of the standard streams/ qDebug.

Fractals:
	Basic shapes (Triangle, Rectangle, Torus, ).
	Mandelbulb.
	Mandelbox.
	Kaledioscopic IFS.
	4D shapes

Rendering:
	Anti aliasing.
	High resolution render + downscale.

	Transformations.
	Multiple objects in scene with boolean operators on DE.

	Ambient occlusion.
	Lighting support (Hard and soft shadows).
	Reflections.
	Transmissive.
	Add more colouring schemes.

Enhancements:
Project:
	Use issues instead of this document.
	CMake:
		Viewer should compile with Werror without external code errors.
		Visual studio:
			Show folders as filters.
			Show Header files.

User Experience:
	Improve input fields for floats and doubles.
	Set minimum inspector width in order to avoid hiding inputs.
	Show uniform editor buttons under each other when window is small.

Code:
	Document code (files, classes and files).
	Use clang-tidy:
		Remove single line statements (if, for, while).
		Add newline after "break;" in switch statements.
		Use = default for empty destructors.

	Set clang-format to:
		break before closing ')' if it does not fit in a single line.

	Refactor lexer and parser for better error handling.
	Move GLSL struct default values to variable declaration instead of struct definition.

Performance:
	Render image by splitting it into smaller tiles.
	Reduce detail while panning/ moving camera.
	Render with increased detail if camera is not moving.

	Take increasingly more samples if camera stays still.
