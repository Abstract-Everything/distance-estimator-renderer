Features:
	User experience:
		Save Rendered image.
		Add constraints to glsl variables (Valid range, should be normalized, ..).
		Put all errors in a logger instead of the standard streams/ qDebug.
		An editor to easily move and position the objects at interactive speeds.
		About and help section with user manual.

	Editor:
		Save and Load scenes.

	Fractals:
		Basic shapes (Triangle, Rectangle, Torus, ).
		Mandelbulb.
		Mandelbox.
		Kaledioscopic IFS.
		4D shapes.

	Scene:
		Multiple objects with boolean operators on DE.

	Camera:
		Move relative to forward.
		Option to use target coordinate to force the camera to look at.
		Animation paths to record a video.
		Fish eye lense.
		Equirectengular.
		Fulldome.

	Rendering:
		Anti aliasing.
		High resolution render + downscale.
		Take increasingly more samples if camera stays still.

		Transformations.

		Add more colouring schemes.

		Light:
			Ambient occlusion.
			Soft shadows.
			Hard shadows.

		Materials:
			Reflections.
			Transmissive.

Enhancements:
	Project:
		Use issues instead of this document.
		CMake:
			Viewer should compile with Werror without external code errors.
			Visual studio:
				Show qml files in solution explorer.

	Building:
		Add continuous integration.
		Build release packages with CPU and GPU support for Windows and Ubuntu.

	Development
		Add tests.
		Refactor lexer and parser for better error handling.
		Move GLSL struct default values to variable declaration instead of struct definition.

	Code:
		Document code (files, classes and files).
		Use clang-tidy:
			Remove single line statements (if, for, while).
			Add newline after "break;" in switch statements.
			Use = default for empty destructors.

		Set clang-format to:
			break before closing ')' if it does not fit in a single line.

	User Experience:
		Improve input fields for floats and doubles.
		Set minimum inspector width in order to avoid hiding inputs.
		Show uniform editor buttons under each other when window is small.
		Show uniform variables under each other since most tabs only have a few.

	Performance:
		Render image by splitting it into smaller tiles.
		Reduce detail while panning/ moving camera.
		Render with increased detail if camera is not moving.
		Do not rerender if scene does not change.
